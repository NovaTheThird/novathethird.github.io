        Hi. My name is Nicholas. I am a student studying Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology.

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Gameplay Programmer</h2><p>
        Given the nature of a school like DigiPen, I started out creating games with only myself and other programmers.
        As I've continued to create games, despite my specification leaning me more towards graphics and engine, I still retain
        a large skillset in programming gameplay behaviors and systems.</p></li>
      <li><h2>Engine Architecture</h2><p>
        While at DigiPen, I've fallen in love with game engine design and understanding the intricacies of the engine as a whole.
        I played a heavy hand in creating the engine for <a href="/dreadit">Dreadit</a> and am continuing engine development in my free time.
      </p></li>
      <li><h2>Music</h2><p>
        Unrelated to programming, I play a multitude of instruments. I know enough guitar and piano to get me through a decent set and I can
        proficiently play alto saxophone. I've dabbled in music creation for our games however I am no where near professional.
